# Welcome to [Python Link Shortner](https://github.com/bymohamed/LinkShortner)!

This is a simple python code that'll create short unique files redirecting your initial link provided in arguments.<br />


# Files

`generate_php.py` : This file will create php files that you asked for. <br />
`random_generator.py` : This is the main. It generates a unique file name and automatically calls generate_php to create the files.<br />

## How to excute the script

All you need is to excute this command followed by the link (http/https required in the link) :<br />

    python random_generate.py https://www.google.com/
