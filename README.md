# Welcome to [Python Link Shortner](https://github.com/bymohamed/LinkShortner)!

This is a simple python code that'll create short unique files redirecting your initial link provided in arguments.


# Files

`generate_php.py` : This file will create php files that you asked for.
`random_generator.py` : This is the main. It generates a unique file name and automatically calls generate_php to create the files.

## How to excute the script

All you need is to excute this command followed by the link (http/https required in the link) :

    python random_generate.py https://www.google.com/

Feel free to use the code and enjoy!
